### 🧪 4. **Code Playground with Auto-Tests**

- **What it does:** Create a repo where you experiment with code (Python, JavaScript, etc.). GitHub Actions runs tests or linters every time you push code.
    
- **Why it’s helpful:** You get instant feedback and learn CI/CD concepts hands-on.

### 📸 2. **Photo Backup Reminder**

- **What it does:** Set up a GitHub Action that sends you a reminder (via email or webhook) every Sunday to back up your photos or sync them to cloud storage.
    
- **Why it’s useful:** Keeps your memories safe and builds a habit — all automated.
### 📬 5. **Send Yourself a Weekly Digest**

- **What it does:** GitHub Actions scrapes your repo (or even external APIs) and sends you a weekly email with updates — like your GitHub contributions, weather, or news headlines.
    
- **Why it’s cool:** It’s like building your own personal newsletter bot.
